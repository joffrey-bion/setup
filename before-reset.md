# Before-reset checklist

Before you go on and reset the machine to factory settings, make sure to do the following:

* Check for potential important files in `Downloads` or on the desktop
* Check projects that are not git repositories â€” maybe some are worth saving?
* Check the shelved changes stored in the IDE (`.idea/shelf`) instead of being in git branches
* Check all git repositories for uncommited/unpushed changes
  (use [mgitstatus](https://github.com/fboender/multi-git-status/blob/master/mgitstatus))
* Go through the [backup](https://github.com/joffrey-bion/backup) repo, and check if things are up to date
